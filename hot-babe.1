.SH NAME
hot\-babe \- is a small graphical utility which displays the system 
activity in a very special way
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hot\-babe
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B hot\-babe
command.
\fBhot\-babe\fP is a small graphical utility which displays the system 
activity in a very special way. When the CPU is idle, it displays a 
dressed girl, and when the activity goes up, as the temperature 
increases, the girl begins to undress, to finish totally naked when the 
system activity reaches 100%. Of course, if you can be shocked by 
nudity, don't use it!
.SH OPTIONS
As for now, \fBhot\-babe\fP supports a few command\-line options:
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
display a small help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-threshold n
ensure that only the first picture (totally dressed girl) as long as the 
system activity is below n%.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-delay
n update the display every n milliseconds.
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-incremental
ponder every sample with time, the result is a somewhat smoother 
animation, and the cpu has to be 100% for a long time before the girl 
will be totally naked, and the cpu has to be at 0% for a long time for 
the girl to dress totally.
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-noNice
Don't consider reniced processes. This is usefull if you use seti@home 
or distributed.net, which always eat almost all the CPU.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nice
n Put the hot\-babe process in nice n.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-dir
Directory give the directory where hot\-babe must load the pictures.
.TP
.B \-g, \-\-geometry
Use the specified geometry (only position is supported {+|-}x{+|x}y).
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-composite
Force hot-babe to use compositing. The default is to autodetect compositing.
.TP
.B \-C, \-\-nocomposite
Force hot-babe to not using compositing.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B $(PREFIX)/share/hot\-babe/ ./hot\-babe/
Default directory of hot\-babes pictures. It can be either absolute 
path, relative, relative to share/hot\-babe/ directory or relative to 
~/.hot\-babe/ directory. It contains the themes that can be used. 
$(PREFIX) defaults to /usr/local.
.P
.B Note:
Each pictures subdirectory must contain a file named "descr" which gives 
some info to the hot\-babe process. The first line gives the number of 
pictures to use, and then the name of the pictures, one per
line. Furthmore, the pictures must have the same dimensions, and in 
non-compositing mode 127 on the alpha channel is used for defining a 
bitmask for the window. The bitmask is created from the last image in
the animation.
